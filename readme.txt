Adds a lightweight Google Custom Search to your website, without the need for
JavaScript.

== Description ==

This plugin adds Google Custom Search to your website, but unlike other plugins
operates on the server side, thus eliminating the need for JavaScript and
keeping the page size small.

The admin interface is based on that used by the WP Google Search plugin
https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-google-search/

The interface with the Google API is based on code by Jason Clark for Montana
State University - Digital Collection Search
https://github.com/jasonclark/digital-collections-custom-search-api

= Available languages =
* English
* Spanish (incomplete)

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.
2. Activate it through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Register your Google Custom Search Engine and get your Google Search Engine ID and API key here: https://www.google.com/cse/
4. Enable the plugin and enter the Google Search Engine ID and API key (Settings -> Server-Side Google Search)
