This plugin adds Google Custom Search to your website, but unlike other plugins
operates on the server side, thus eliminating the need for JavaScript and
keeping the page size small.

== Description ==

If you would like a lightweight Google search feature on your WordPress site,
you need to register with Google Custom Search, get your Google Search Engine ID
and API key, and enter them in the plugin settings page (Settings -> Server-Side
Google Search). Put the new Google search-box widget on the sidebar. Note that
your theme will need to override the page that displays the "Nothing Found"
message when the search results are displayed.
